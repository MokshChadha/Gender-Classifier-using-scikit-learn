# Gender-Classifier-using-scikit-learn
We are using Scikit learn package in python to classify the gender of a person from their body measurements

Module Used :- Scikit 

Classifiers used 
1. Decision Tree
Decision tree is a type of supervised learning algorithm (having a pre-defined target variable) that is mostly used
in classification problems. It works for both categorical and continuous input and output variables. In this 
technique, we split the population or sample into two or more homogeneous sets (or sub-populations) based on
most significant splitter / differentiator in input variables.

2.SVM(support vector machine)
It is a classification method. In this algorithm, we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space (where 
n is number of features you have) with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate.
For example, if we only had two features like Height and Hair length of an individual, we’d first plot these two 
variables in two dimensional space where each point has two co-ordinates (these co-ordinates are known as Support Vectors)
Now, we will find some line that splits the data between the two differently classified groups of data.
This will be the line such that the distances from the closest point in each of the two groups will be farthest away.

3.Linear Regression
It is used to estimate real values (cost of houses, number of calls, total sales etc.) based on continuous 
variable(s). Here, we establish relationship between independent and dependent variables by fitting a best line. 
This best fit line is known as regression line and represented by a linear equation Y= a *X + b.
In this equation:

    Y – Dependent Variable
    a – Slope
    X – Independent variable
    b – Intercept

4.Naive Bayes
It is a classification technique based on Bayes’ theorem with an assumption of independence between predictors. In simple terms, 
a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any
other feature
For example, a fruit may be considered to be an apple if it is red, round, and about 3 inches in diameter. 
Even if these features depend on each other or upon the existence of the other features, a naive Bayes classifier would
consider all of these properties to independently contribute to the probability that this fruit is an apple.
 
 Naive Bayesian model is easy to build and particularly useful for very large data sets. Along with simplicity,
